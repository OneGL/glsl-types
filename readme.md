# GLSL-Types

GLSL-Types is a lightweight library designed to generate TypeScript types for GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shaders. By leveraging the [glsl](https://docs.rs/glsl/latest/glsl/) crate, this library simplifies the integration between GLSL and TypeScript, enabling developers to safely and efficiently use GLSL code within TypeScript projects.

### Features

- Automatic Type Generation: Automatically generate TypeScript types based on GLSL shader code.
- Type Safety: Helps prevent runtime errors by ensuring type correctness when working with shaders in TypeScript.
- Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrates with GLSL shaders, making it easy to use in projects requiring WebGL or other GLSL-based graphics rendering.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### How to use

```bash
node dist/index.js -f ./shaders/test.vert
```

### Example

Given the following GLSL vertex shader code:

```glsl
#version 300 es

in vec2 aPosition;
uniform mat3 uProjection;
uniform mat3 uTransform;
uniform vec4 uColor;

out vec4 vColor;

void main() {
    vec3 position = uProjection * uTransform * vec3(aPosition, 1.0f);
    gl_Position = vec4(position.xy, 0.0f, 1.0f);
    vColor = uColor;
}
```

The library will generate the following TypeScript types:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
// This file is generated by glsl-types

const SOURCE = /* glsl */ `#version 300 es

// File: test.vert
in vec2 aPosition;
uniform mat3 uProjection;
uniform mat3 uTransform;
uniform vec4 uColor;

out vec4 vColor;

void main() {
    vec3 position = uProjection * uTransform * vec3(aPosition, 1.0f);
    gl_Position = vec4(position.xy, 0.0f, 1.0f);
    vColor = uColor;
}`;

export const Test = {
  uniforms: {
    uProjection: "mat3",
    uTransform: "mat3",
    uColor: "vec4",
  },
  ins: {
    aPosition: "vec2",
  },
  outs: {
    vColor: "vec4",
  },
  source: SOURCE,
};
```
